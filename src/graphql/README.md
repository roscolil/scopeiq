# GraphQL Generated Files

This directory contains auto-generated GraphQL files from AWS Amplify:

- `API.ts` - GraphQL API types and schema definitions
- `mutations.ts` - GraphQL mutation operations
- `queries.ts` - GraphQL query operations
- `subscriptions.ts` - GraphQL subscription operations
- `index.ts` - Re-exports all GraphQL operations for easy importing

## Usage

Instead of importing from individual files, you can import from the index:

```typescript
// Import specific operations
import { createProject, updateProject } from '@/graphql'

// Import types
import type { Project, CreateProjectInput } from '@/graphql'
```

## Note

These files are auto-generated by Amplify. Any manual changes will be overwritten when the schema is updated. If Amplify regenerates these files in the root directory, they should be moved back to this directory.
