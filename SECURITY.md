# Security Checklist

This document outlines security practices implemented in this project for handling sensitive credentials and API keys.

## ✅ Security Measures Implemented

### Environment Variables

- ✅ All AWS credentials moved to environment variables
- ✅ All API keys moved to environment variables
- ✅ `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- ✅ `.env.example` provided as template
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in source code
- ✅ Environment validation functions implemented

### AWS Security

- ✅ AWS credentials loaded from environment variables only
- ✅ Safe credential loading with error handling
- ✅ Debug logging that doesn't expose actual credentials
- ✅ Proper error messages without revealing sensitive data

### Development Practices

- ✅ README updated with environment setup instructions
- ✅ Clear documentation about credential management
- ✅ Separation of example and actual environment files

## 🔄 Ongoing Security Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - They contain real credentials
2. **Use `.env.example`** - Copy this to `.env` and fill in real values
3. **Rotate API keys regularly** - Especially if they might be compromised
4. **Use least privilege** - Only grant necessary AWS permissions
5. **Monitor API usage** - Watch for unusual activity

### For Production

1. **Use proper secret management** - Consider AWS Secrets Manager or similar
2. **Enable CloudTrail** - For AWS API call auditing
3. **Set up billing alerts** - To catch unauthorized usage
4. **Use IAM roles** - Instead of access keys when possible
5. **Regular security audits** - Review access and permissions

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

If credentials are compromised:

1. **Immediately rotate the credentials**:
   - AWS: Generate new access keys, delete old ones
   - OpenAI: Generate new API key, revoke old one
2. **Update environment variables** in all environments

3. **Review logs** for any unauthorized usage

4. **Update any deployed applications** with new credentials

## 📝 Environment Variables Reference

Required variables (see `.env.example`):

- AWS credentials: Access key and secret key for S3 operations
- AWS region: Region for S3 bucket operations  
- S3 bucket name: Target bucket for file storage
- OpenAI API key: For AI-powered document analysis
- Google Places API key: For location-based features## 🔍 Security Validation

The application includes automatic validation:

- Environment variable presence checking
- Credential format validation
- Safe error handling without credential exposure
- Debug logging that masks sensitive data
