- It includes details about semantic search functionality
- The system should generate embeddings for this content
- Users should be able to search for "project testing" and find this document

Technical Details:
- The document is uploaded to S3
- Text extraction happens in the background
- Embeddings are generated using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model
- The embeddings are stored in Pinecone for semantic search
